# Tableau - Citi Bike Analytics


## Project Overview

![Citi-Bikes](Images/citi-bike-station-bikes.jpg)

Since 2013, the Citi Bike Program has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program's utilization. Through the team's efforts, each month bike data is collected, organized, and made public on the [Citi Bike Data](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data) webpage.

However, while the data has been regularly updated, the team has yet to implemented a dashboard or sophisticated reporting process. The task is to generate regular reports for city officials looking to publicize and improve the city program.

## Project scope

** First step was to aggregate the data found in the Citi Bike Trip History Logs. We collected data for the months of February and March of 2020. **  
March 2020 was the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic and Newyork was one of the first states in the United states to be worst affected by the pandemic.
We aimed at visualizing the effects of pandemic on the Citi Bike rides.

* A Tableau story was created that brings together the visualizations, maps, and dashboards.
